      "I love making role-playing characters. In order to make sure each
      character has a unique backstory of wonder and woe, I created Better
      Backstories. This easy to use and easy to customize system is genre
      neutral, and these cards can help everyone to make better backstories. It
      doesn't matter if you're a novice making their first fighter, or an expert
      game master developing their corrupted galactic president. Better
      Backstories are suitable for Player Characters, Non-Player Characters, and
      Game Masters alike. They are designed to jump start your imagination and
      make your characters come to life."
